make sure inference.py does the following

1. import already trained vae from file path (look at train.py from diffusion for example)
2. import already trained diffusion model from file path (look at evaluate.py for example)
3. pass sample from file path to vae encoder
4. pass output of 3 to diffusion model 
5. pass output of 4 to vae decoder
6. pass 6 through the visualizer (napari)

trough these steps we should be able to use the napari interface to look at the fully processed sample in 3d and in slices. 

the following links are examples of how this could be implemented:
